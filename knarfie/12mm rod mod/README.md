This mod has been created to allow for 12mm hardened steel rods, and LM12LUU bearings, instead of the stock 10mm bearings.

Only hole size has been changed, and screw positions (intersected with the 12mm rods otherwise)

The LM12LUU Mount is a friction fit.

All parts have been tested with LM12LUU bearings and 12mm hardened steel rods.

Showcase:
