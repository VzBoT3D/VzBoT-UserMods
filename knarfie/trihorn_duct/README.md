The VZBot trihorn duct was developed for the use in high speed 3d printing. High airflow is essential when wanting to cool material fast, thus the trihorn was born! EVA trihorn mods from the 2.3 version were not good enough for me, so I developed a new trihorn version with my friend Hugo. It will be displayed here! 

This version is currently only available for the Dragon hotend and any similar models in terms of nozzle height (e3d V6 for example)

This trihorn mod has 2 versions, a resin printed and FDM printed version. Its an easy print, but the resin model has infinitely small splitter, compared to the 0.4mm splitter on the FDM one. This has been done to make sure the model is actually printable, while splitting the air as efficiently as possible. 

If you have any questions, DM knarfie#0001 through the VZBot discord! Enjoy!

Print orientation is advised as duct inlet down (FDM) or 45deg angled for resin printers.
