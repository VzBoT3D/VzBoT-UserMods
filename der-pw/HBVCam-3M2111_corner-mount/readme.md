## Corner bracket mounting for a HVBCam [![License: CC BY-SA 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--SA%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)


The camera can be mounted in the top left corner. It is possible to lead the cable out backwards in one of the profiles. If you use the HBVCam-3M2111, you have a view angle of 110Â° and thus a complete overview of the print bed. With this arm, it fits nicely at the Vz235, It is quite possible that it also fits on the Vz330, but untested.

The camera has not the best quality, see for yourself, but it is sufficient for monitoring the printing room.

First screw "Bracket_Part1" to the rear half of the case. Use the M2.5x6 screws for this.
Then the lens has to be unscrewed. But this is possible without any problems. Then you put the camera in the front housing shell, after that put the lens back on to protect the sensor from dust and specks. Put the rear case shell on and screw both halves tight. Use the M2.5x12 screws. Screw the "Bracket_Part2" to the "Bracket_Part1" using the M2.5x12 screw.
The case should be finished. Now you can attach the camera into the top left corner of your Vz235.
