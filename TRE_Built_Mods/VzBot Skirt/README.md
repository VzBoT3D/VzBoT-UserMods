Here Is My VzBot Skirt design!

Overall Height from bottom extrusion is 50mm and will support under belly electronics if you'd like also can do just skirt for looks!
* The power plug in rear skirt is same plug from VzBot also if un sure (15A 250V BIQU) LINK ( https://www.amazon.com/BIQU-Rocker-Switch-Socket-Module/dp/B07KS2TQ45/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1AUOWP7VZZAJ&keywords=biqu%2B15a%2B250v%2Brocker%2Bswitch%2Bpower%2Bsocket%2Binlet%2Bmodule&qid=1643858694&sprefix=250v%2Bbiq%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-3&th=1 )

* The ethernet/internet plug is cat 6 D panel plug LINK ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081P826R6/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_1?smid=A3JISXJ5AQCA73&psc=1 ) the cool thing with d panel ports is this can be used for - Cat6, hdmi, usb and a few others.
  
* Fans are 40mm and you can use any thicknes of fan ud like I'm using 40x10mm fans

* Printing!!  I recommend printing skirts laying on their backs and add to small supports to the dovetail interlocks on each skirt. Be ready as this will be a retraction torture test (lol) I set my minimum travel after retraction to 4mm to reduce some unnecessary retractions and not loose print quality!

(If using skirt just for looks and dont want electronics underneath you can print 2 sets of front skirts!)
