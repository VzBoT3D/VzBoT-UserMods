# VzBoT-Skirt is here
Hello guys, this is my VzBot Skirt design!

The overall height from bottom extrusion is 50mm and will support electronics under the frame. If you like the design, you can also do the skirt just for looks!

## Required parts:

* The power plug in  the rear skirt is the same plug from VzBot-BOM: (15A 250V BIQU) [LINK]( https://www.amazon.com/BIQU-Rocker-Switch-Socket-Module/dp/B07KS2TQ45/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1AUOWP7VZZAJ&keywords=biqu%2B15a%2B250v%2Brocker%2Bswitch%2Bpower%2Bsocket%2Binlet%2Bmodule&qid=1643858694&sprefix=250v%2Bbiq%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-3&th=1)

* The ethernet/internet plug is a cat 6 D-Panel plug [LINK]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081P826R6/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_1?smid=A3JISXJ5AQCA73&psc=1)
  * the cool thing with D-Panel ports is this that they can be used for Cat6, HDMI, USB and a few others.
 
* The feet retain VzBots design of the original feet but extended hieght as mentioned above as for the rubber feet that can be fitted internally plese view [LINK](https://www.ebay.com/itm/254543677997?var=554291871564)
  * The VzBot foot spacer has been added to the stl folder this spacer is ment to be scaled to hieght you may need for different feet
  
* Fans are 40mm and you can use any thicknes of fan you like. I'm using 40x10mm fans.

## Printing:

I recommend printing skirts laying on their backs and add to small supports to the dovetail interlocks on each skirt. Be ready as this will be a retraction torture test (lol) I set my minimum travel after retraction to 4mm to reduce some unnecessary retractions and not loose print quality!

### Want the Skirts just for looks?

If using skirt just for looks and dont want electronics underneath you can print 2 sets of front skirts instead of the front and the rear!
