Here Is My VzBot Skirt design!

Overall Height from bottom extrusion is 50mm and will support under belly electronics if ud like also can do just skirt for looks!
* The power plug in rear skirt is same plug from VzBot also if un sure (15A 250V BIQU)
  + The ethernet/internet plug is cat 6 D panel plug LINK ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081P826R6/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_1?smid=A3JISXJ5AQCA73&psc=1 ) the cool thing with d panel ports is this can be used for - Cat6, hdmi, usb and a few others.
* Fans are 40mm and you can use any thicknes of fan ud like I'm using 40x10mm fans

* Printing I used 2 small supports on the connections between each set and lay all components flat on backs for printing!

(If using skirt just for looks and dont want electronics underneath you can print 2 sets of front skirts!)
