# Patch_Cura
 This Repo is a patch for Cura users to update all Tronxy profiles, while waiting for the updates to be included in an official Cura release.

There has been some special work put into this patch, which includes major improvements to print quality, removal of speed limitations, as well as the addition of dual extrusion support. Support has been added for multiple machines, including but not limited to the new D01 Plus, and XY-3 Pro V2.

IT IS RECOMMENDED TO UPGRADE TO THE LATEST VERSION OF CURA BEFORE INSTALLING THIS PACKAGE!!!!  Once Cura has installed, do not open it. Just follow the instructions below. If you have any pre-built profiles that you would like to keep, export them before proceeding.

To install, download the complete .zip
Extract the .zip file to your desktop. Copy the "resources" folder and navigate through Windows file explorer to your Ultimaker Cura file folder (typically C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura xxxxx). Drag and drop the entire resources folder into the Ultimaker Cura folder. Allow windows to over-write ALL FILES. 

VzBot Users: A new mesh for the bed surface has been loaded, this is under the Tronxy X5SA printer profile. This will also be included in the next release, however it will need to be manually activated.
