This is a remix of eva frontplate to make it fit to the vzbot with correct belt path.

I also made v6, and volcano custom trihorn fan ducts, along with 8mm probe adapter that works with v6 and volcano block.

To install the frontplate you first need to fully assemble your hemera(hot tightning can be done after mounted), then mount it. You'll also have to use the ball tip end of your allan key for the bottom right and left screw of your front plate.

Also made a silicon bed spacer
