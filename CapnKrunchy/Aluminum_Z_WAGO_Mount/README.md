![VZ330-AluZ-BedWago](Images/Render.png)


## Description
This is a mount for 6 WAGO 221-412 levernuts that mounts to the rear beam on the aluminum Z assembly based on the [V2 Bed Wagos](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/deepfriedheroin/v2_bed_wagos) mod by deepfriedheroin from the Voron community. It is intended to simplify wiring of the AC heated print bed and allow removal of the bed without disconnecting wiring from the electronics bay.

This mount is designed for the Vz330 and was tested with the Mellow Vz330 AWD kit. It may be compatible with the Vz235 aluminum Z assembly as well; however, this has not been tested.

The recommended mounting orientation is with the WAGOs facing downwards on the bottom side of the Z assembly to avoid melting. The mount can be installed with the opening of the WAGOs facing the front or back of the printer.

## Assembly
* Install heatset inserts into the 4 holes on the bottom of the Clamps.
* Insert the WAGOs into the Mount by inserting the back of the WAGO at an angle and pivoting downwards while sliding toward the back of the mount. This may take some force. The WAGOs should snap into place.
