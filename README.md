**Remember to update this README when uploading new mod!**

## Directory structure

Create a folder containing your name (without spaces) and create a folder for your mod(s).

Suggested directory layout for your mod:
- `creator_name/`
  - `mod_name/`
    - `README.md` with a description, optionally build instructions and required parts
    - `stl/` folder with stereolithographical models, oriented correctly for printing
    - `cad/` folder with original design files (STEP, F3D, Scad, etc.) (optional)
    - `doc/` folder with supported documentation (optional)
    - `images/` folder with screen shots/renders/etc.

## Table structure

Update the following table with the information about your mod:
- Your name
- A link to your sub-folder
- A short description of your mod
- The build difficulty:
  - `:green_heart:` for :green_heart: (Easy)
  - `:blue_heart:` for :blue_heart: (Intermediate)
  - `:heart:` for :heart: (Advanced)

like so:
`
| Creator | [Mod title](link) | Description | Difficulty `

---

| Creator | Mod title | Description | Difficulty
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *creator_name* | [*Mod Title*](./creator_here/mod_folder_name) | *Example description (short).* |:green_heart::blue_heart::heart:
| *knarfie* | [*Trihorn*](./knarfie/trihorn_duct) | *Trihorn duct for the VZ Printhead* |:green_heart:
