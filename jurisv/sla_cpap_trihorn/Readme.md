## SLA One piece CPAP Trihorn fan ducts
### This is mod of original fan ducts optimized as one piece for printing with SLA resin printers.

Two flavors available
: For CPAP setup without standoff braces.

: And one with additional holes for standoff mounting for additional rigidity.

### Printing
I used Lychee slicer with layer height of 50 microns and printed in smoky black semi-transparent resin. 
For this application ABS like resin is recommended.
Applying minimal anti-aliasing did yield a smoother part, but if your printer does not support it, that will not be a deal-breaker as the part still looks very nice. 
Rotate the part on it's belly and slightly angle one of the horns. Since the part is very thin, I used automatically placed light supports and then manually added ones for unsupported islands. 

Important. The mounting holes have modelled threads in it. Since resin becomes brittle under pressure, you have to clean the threads after part is cured.
Do not try to force the crew in, it should go in smoothly. 

To clean the threads use M3 x 0.5 tap.

Cleaned and ready for an assembly.

### Assembly
Assembly is straight forward and does not require special tools.
Use 2 M3x10 button head screws, or ultra low profile ones if you have available.

### Note
* Some users noted that in this form it will add extra steps if disassembly would be required to get the fan ducts out of the way. This is fair observation and I have some ideas that will try out for version 2.
