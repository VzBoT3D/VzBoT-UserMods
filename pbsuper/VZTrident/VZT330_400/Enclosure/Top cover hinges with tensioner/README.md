# NOTE:
- depending on the thickness used for the rear enclosure aluminum panel (or acrylic or whatever panel used) versus the thickness of the top cover acrylic panels, you may need to add spacers behind the bottom part of the hinges to match the thickness of the top cover rear panel. Spacers STLs can be found in the STL folder. Scale them to desired size

For instance: A rear aluminum panel of 1/16" (1.6mm) will need about 1.4mm of spacer to fit to the top acrylic panel (If the top acrylic panel is 3mm)
