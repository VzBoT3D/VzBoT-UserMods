# BOM is for one side only. You will need 2. 

## (Note: Since Carbon fiber tube dimensions are not always the same, you may need to add spacers (printed) between aluminum part and cabon tube. My tubes were 20.85mm and 20.65mm. I used the 20.85mm one with no washer. So depending on your luck, you may need to add spacers. See in the STL folder. you can scale it in Z in your slicer to fit your tube)

## When torquing the the idlers, make sure you do not apply to much axial load on the idler bearings. Tight manually with hands then add 1/4. Make sure idlers spin freely. This will avoid rattling sound, specially if you use graphite or metal spacers sold by mellow Kit)
