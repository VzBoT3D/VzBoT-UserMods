## BOM needed:
- 4xM3 6mm Ultra low profile bolts
- cable holder (printed)

# Step 2 : Assembling the carriage
- Install the top plate on the X MGN9 slider
- Install the back, front, and bottom plates

## BOM needed:
- 12xM3 6mm Ultra low profile bolts (For all 8 corners and MGN9 bloc)


# Step 3: Mounting the the X stop switch (Optional: if you don't use sensorless homing)

### Rat Rig Vcore3 users: You will need to add this X stopper to your Left Xy joiner. STL found [here](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/PrintHeads/Vz-Print%20Head%20Alu-CF/STLs/Vcore3%20specific/Vcore3_X_stopper.stl) 
Please note that you will need a 15mm M5 bolt instead of a 12mm

Also, you can re-use the Vcore original X switch with this [mount](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/PrintHeads/Vz-Print%20Head%20Alu-CF/STLs/Vcore3%20specific/X-endstop-mount.stl)

## BOM needed:
- 2 x M3 6mm Ultra low profile bolts
- 2 x M2 screws (not included in the kit)
- Microswitch https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_AL9anj
- Switch mount (Printed)

# Step 4: Install the rear adjustable fan mount

## BOM needed:
- 2 x M3 8mm Ultra low profile bolts
- 2 x M3 Nuts

# Step 5: Install the belts.
- make sure motor mounts are a lowest tension possible first.
- Start by the front. Insert the end of the belt through the side slot and loop the belt on itself. Insert a piece of filament (6mm) in the loop and then slowly pull the belt back in the slot until secures in place.
- For the back, simply loop the belt arround the pillar, and give it a pre-tention on the belt, then attach it with a zip tie, or a printed belt clip (Found in the [STL](https://github.com/VzBot3D/VzBot/tree/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/PrintHeads/Vz-Print%20Head%20Alu-CF/STLs) folder) . [belt clip](https://github.com/VzBot3D/VzBot/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/PrintHeads/Vz-Print%20Head%20Alu-CF/STLs/Belt_clip.stl)

# Step 5.1
Take a rum shot. This step is definately needed after the belts job. It takes a bit of patience to route the belts in the front idlers, with a small screw driver, its very doable

# Step 6: Install the fan duct

## BOM needed:
- 2 x M3 10mm bolts
- 2 x M3 Nuts
- Upper fan duct (printed)
- Lower fan fuct (printed)

# Step 7: Install your favorite extruder/hotend combo.

# Step 7.1
Take a second well deserved rum shot. Please note that beer can be used in this step.

# Step 8 : Adjust the fan height
Loosen the 2 M3 8mm bolts, and ajust height according to your Hotend

## BOM needed:
(No probe):
- 1 x M3 20mm bolt - (For right side of the fan when you face printer - When NOT using probe)
- 1 x M3 25mm bolt - (for left side  Please note the left side bolt orientation is different to clear the belt)
