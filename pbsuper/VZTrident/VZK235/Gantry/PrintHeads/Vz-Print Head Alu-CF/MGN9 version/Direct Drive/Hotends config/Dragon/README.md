# Hardware needed:

- (2xM3 6mm Ultra low profile screws - To attach to top plate (Not needed if you bolt it directly to top head when used with a longer heatblock)


# Vcore 3
## (Note for Vcore3 users: Since the printhead is taller on Vcore3, you have to use the Crazy volcano heatbloc, or if you keep the standard V6 type heatbloc, you will have to use the Grove Mount adapter sold at F3D [here ](https://f3d-racing-fdm.myshopify.com/products/vzbot-mgn9-printhead-v6-groove-mount-pre-order). Or use a printed spacer found [here](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/PrintHeads/Vz-Print%20Head%20Alu-CF/STLs/Vcore3%20specific/Dragon%205mm%20spacer.stl). to have the hotend sit low enough to clear the par cooling fan duct.
