- (2xM3 6mm Ultra low profile screws - To attach to top plate)

# Vcore 3
## (Note for Vcore3 users: Since the printhead is taller on Vcore3, you will have to use the Grove Mount adapter sold at F3D [here ](https://f3d-racing-fdm.myshopify.com/products/vzbot-mgn9-printhead-v6-groove-mount-pre-order) and the Mosquito grove mount fitting. Or use a printed spacer found [here](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/PrintHeads/Vz-Print%20Head%20Alu-CF/STLs/Vcore3%20specific/Mosquito%204mm%20spacer.stl). to have the hotend sit low enough to clear the par cooling fan duct.
