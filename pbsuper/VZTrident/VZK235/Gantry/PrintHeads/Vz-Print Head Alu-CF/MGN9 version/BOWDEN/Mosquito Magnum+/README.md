The Mosquito Magnum+ is a very long type of hotend, and a bit heavier than others. When using bowden configuration, you can not bolt the M+ to the top plate directly as the bolts will interfere with the Bowden pneumatic fitting (PC4-M4). So you have to use the adapter plate.

Due to it's weight, it is highly suggested to add lower braces to support the M+. The bellow option is using thin (0.3mm) titanium sheet that you can cut manually to size using normal metal cisor. It will secure to the M2.5 bolts on the M+ that is used to hold the thermistors. Titanium must be used due to it's low thermal conductivity. Heat transfer will be minimal, and transfered to the carriage M3 bolts. It would be best to chose the bottom carriage plate in Aluminum instead of Carbon Fiber. (We will be testing the carbon fiber option soon to see if it is affected by heat)
