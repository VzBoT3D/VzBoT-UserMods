The Mosquito and Mosquito Magnum are very compact and short lenght hotend. In order to to have it sit low enough to reach the bed and the fan duct, one needs to use the adapter plate. However, if you use a Volcomosq/NF Crazy Volcano, you can bolt it directly to the top plate without the adapter plate.

Or use a printed spacer found [here](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/PrintHeads/Vz-Print%20Head%20Alu-CF/STLs/Vcore3%20specific/Mosquito%204mm%20spacer.stl). to have the hotend sit low enough to clear the par cooling fan duct.
