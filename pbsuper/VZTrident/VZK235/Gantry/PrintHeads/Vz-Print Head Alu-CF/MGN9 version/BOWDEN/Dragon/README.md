The Dragon hotend is quite short. To mount it you will need the Adapter plate to lower it by 3mm. However, if you use a longer heatblock like Mellow NG crazy Volcano one, you can bolt it directly to the top plate without the adapter. You will save about 3-3.5g.

# Hardware needed:
- (4xM2.5 5mm Ultra Low profile screws - To mount the Dragon to the Adapter plate)
- (2xM3 6mm Ultra low profile screws - To attach to top plate (Not needed if you bolt it directly to top head when used with a longer heatblock)

# Vcore 3
## (Note for Vcore3 users: Since the printhead is taller on Vcore3, you have to use the Crazy volcano heatbloc, or if you keep the standard V6 type heatbloc, you will have to use the Grove Mount adapter sold at F3D [here ](https://f3d-racing-fdm.myshopify.com/products/vzbot-mgn9-printhead-v6-groove-mount-pre-order). Or use a printed spacer found [here](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/PrintHeads/Vz-Print%20Head%20Alu-CF/STLs/Vcore3%20specific/Dragon%205mm%20spacer.stl). to have the hotend sit low enough to clear the par cooling fan duct.
