## MGN7C is an optional thing. It only requires an adapter plate, and the rest of instructions are the same as MGN9. So you can go in the MGN9 section for that.
### The adapter can be purchased from F3D store. 


# Additional step:
- Install the MGN9H to MGN7C adpater plate on the MGN7 bloc. Using 4xM2 4mm flat head counter sunk bolts.
