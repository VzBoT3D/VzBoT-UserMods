For Quickdraw 2 we have have 2 Dock options for the normal hotends.

Normal dock can be used on Dragon/Rapido/NF-Crazy with the HF versions and in NF-crazy case with the vulcano block.

Sliding dock can also be used with the hotends above but also works with longer Hotends. This means the UHF version of Dragon and Rapido or a Vulcano block Hotend with a Extender attached.

Thanks to Chop3D for making the Sliding dock.
