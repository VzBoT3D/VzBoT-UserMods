This is the Y gantry bottom parts for the VzBoT Vz330. They are used to replace X gantry to lower cost, lighter weight 1515 size instead of 2020 size.

The geometry and shape is based on the Vz330 V1.2's Y gantry except for minor differences and is fully compatible.

note: After the Vz330 V1.2 is released, the left and the right of the Y gantry are not common parts.  If you are using less than V1.2, please re-printing and combining Y-gantry-top-left and Y-gantry-top-right released by official VzBoT.

## Tested

### Using a 1515 gantry:

I have long term tested using an aluminium 15x15xt1.5 square tube and a MGN12H for X gantry about one year and confirmed there are not really any problems for printing.

### This Y-Gantry-1515:

They are printed IEMAI CF-ABS and tested over the 3 months of 300-600mm/s high speed printings and do not show any problems.
