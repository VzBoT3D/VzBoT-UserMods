# X5SA Z
This is a mod to reuse some of the original X5SA Z components (If adapting a VZBot330 from a Tronxy X5SA).

THis reuses the original aluminum Z platforms while also utilizing the stock VzBot (printed) Z axis components. 

The VzBot Z Axis components will need different spacing to align the bed with the print head and two 2020 extrusions are used to span the gap between the two platforms. One of which can be the original X5SA Y axis extrusion if it was replaced.

The intent of this mod is to reuse the original Z platforms while also moving the z axis inside the printer's frame so it does not interfere with an enclosure.

The included spacre may not work for all printer configurations as this was configured for use with the EVA 3 toolhead and may result in different spacing from the VzBot or EVA 2 toolheads.
