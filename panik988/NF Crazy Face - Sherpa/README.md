From an idea started by panik988 I decided to fix same issues and alignment of this face to mount an NF CRAZY VOLCANO by Mellow with Sherpa extruder and constrain it with a bracket to reduce minimal vibrations.

NOTICE: This is still in beta, please open issues or contact me on discord to fix them.
