# Bedframe
Solid alu frame for your VzBoT-Vz235.
It't the simple way to increase precision of assembly and save time.
This is also a cheaper version than with an 8mm table.
This version designed for flange bearing like a LMK10LUU (it's necessary to cut an M4 thread)

*Material - Aluminium alloy 3000, 5000 or 6000 series*

*Thinkness - 5mm (6mm allowed)*
