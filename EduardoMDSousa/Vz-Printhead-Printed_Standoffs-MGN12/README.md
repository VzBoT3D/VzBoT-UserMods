The z-Printhead-Printed Printed-Standoffs-MGN12 Version

The Vz-Printhead is a light weight and stiff head made for the VzBoTs, with MGN12H an C on X Axis. It was designed to be compatible with almost all hotends, and extruders out there. With the height adjustable fan duct, you can easily change your config without having to re-print a new fan duct.

In this Mood, the top plate MGN12 H or C is the same as the official version in the main repository, all the duct etc are the same, for that reason those parts are not available here.

here are just the essential parts for the mood.

Note this mood uses 4 M3x45mm screws and 4 M3 lock nuts

It is available Good with description of the parts to facilitate the assembly.

Note, it may be necessary to print extra parts depending on the hotend to use, the extra parts in the STL folders are for Goliath and Rapido, also the new CPAP duct to print as well.

Spacers and so on, can be edited in cad and exported for printing, if any user can't edit I'll be happy to help edit and export the essentials.

in the extra parts folder, the head doc for Klicky prob and NRG versions will also be available
